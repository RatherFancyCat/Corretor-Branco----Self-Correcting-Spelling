This is a Chrome Extention in the works that is meant to automatically fix certain words as you type them.

This is a user-based word speller.
The user will tell the extention the typo and correction that is supposed to be made.

Once the user refreshes the page, or goes into a new one, if he types out the same typo, it will be replaced with the appropriate correction as stated.

These correctionns can be anything the user desires.

NOTE: This was made to be used in the Portuguese Language (PT-pt).
Which accepts certain words and characters within said language;
Such as: "ã, õ, é, ç"

However, it can be used in any language.
Will have to add a language button and translations later on.
